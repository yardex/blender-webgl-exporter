# Introduction #

The JSON exporter is mainly intended to be used on multi-platform scenarios where not only WebGL is used, but also OpenGL ES in embedded platforms like Android, iOS, BB OS, Symbian, WebOS, etc.


**WARNING**: This specification is changed almost monthly, mostly because of a work in progress of the associated 3D engine.

# Details #

This format stresses minification of the JSON output, so it isn't very human readable. Use any JSON viewer to understand its organization.

**WARNING** The JSON exporter has been forked from this project due to several factors. The new project is at http://code.google.com/p/blender-machete/
